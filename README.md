# NBA 2K24

NBA 2K24 is like a frustratingly talented superstar who falls short of delivering championships, season after season. The excellent on-court gameplay bolsters significant depth with its dedication to looking, sounding, and feeling like a genuine NBA experience, but it’s sidelined by heinous microtransactions that plague many of the most popular game modes. These in-game purchases aren’t just present and optional – they are essential to compete with other players online. It’s especially frustrating because MyCareer, the focal point of many changes to this year’s iteration, has so much potential. But if it truly aimed to emulate the beauty of pro basketball, it would reward skill and effort more than open-wallet shortcuts.

Despite being a little short on flashy new mechanics to boast about on the back of the box, NBA 2K24 still looks fantastic and its on-court gameplay is incrementally stronger than ever. Topping the list of additions is the new ProPLAY feature, which allowed 2K to take NBA footage and translate it to in-game animations in real timeIn other words, NBA 2K24 is a lot smoother than its predecessors when it comes to movement on the court, including dribbling, shooting, and pass animations. There are fewer immersion-breaking interactions and things feel generally more authentic.
